# forgetmenot

https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/

## requirements to run this :sob:
* A browser with [metamask](https://metamask.io/) (Chrome, Firefox, Opera or Brave)
* NodeJS
* Truffle (`npm install -g truffle`)

## building and deploying to contract
1. Install the dependencies to run demo 
	>`npm install`

2. Open a console with a local development blockchain
	>`truffle develop`
	
	The address we will be using is: **0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57**
	and the private key: **c87509a1c067bbde78beb793e6fa76530b6382a4c0241e5e4a9ec0a0f44dc0d3**. I'm not sure if these addresses and private keys are hardcoded into truffle, so yours could differ.

3. Deploy the smart contract by the following commands in the *truffle development console*. The out hashes will not match these outputs.
	> **truffle(develop)>** `compile`  
	> Compiling .\contracts\Forgetmenot.sol...  
	> Compiling .\contracts\Migrations.sol...  
	> Writing artifacts to .\build\contracts  
	>  
	> **truffle(develop)>** `migrate`  
	> Using network 'develop'.  
	>   
	> Running migration: 1_initial_migration.js  
	>   Deploying Migrations...

	>   Migrations: 0x8cdaf0cd259887258bc13a92c0a6da92698644c0

4. Open another console window and start the web server. It should open a browser window, but if does not, navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
	> `npm run dev`

## setup metamask

To interact with the contract on store data on the blockchain, you will an Ethereum account and some ether to burn. We will be using the local accounts for this purpose.

1. **Add a custom RPC**. Since we will be running a development blockkchain, we need to point metamask to our local blockchain's RPC address.

	![metamask custom rpc](./README/metamask_custom_rpc.png?raw=true)

2. **Add a develop account with ether**. The truffle dev account comes preloaded with a few accounts you can use for testing. Use any of the *private keys* generated by `truffle develop`.

	![metamask new account](./README/metamask_new_account.png?raw=true)
	

## test drive
When you open the web page, you should see a **super slick** :laughing: page with a box to add a key and a value.
![forgetmenot fresh](./README/forgetmenot_fresh.png?raw=true)

You will note some info about the account you are using.
* **web3 available** : web3 gets injected by Metamask, if this is *false* nothing will work.
* **coinbase** : this is the address of this account generated from the private key. This should match one of the `truffle development` accounts. If you switch accounts in Metamask, just refresh the page (F5)
* **balance**: this should be ~100 ether. If this is 0, switch to an account with some ether in.
 
As you start adding new they will be listed to the right of the input card.
![forgetmenot](./README/forgetmenot.png?raw=true)

When adding a new entry a Metamask popup will appear and ask you to confirm this transaction. Sometimes the popup does not appear, but a badge appears on the Metatmask icon to indicate a pending transaction.

## :unamused: why is this important
